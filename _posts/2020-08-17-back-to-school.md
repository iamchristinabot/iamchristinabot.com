What we are buying for back to school 2020.

#### Backpacks
My youngest daughter is starting nursery school this year, so naturally she needed this super cute butterfly backpack by Skip Hop. It's the perfect size for her and she was very excited about the color, I thought she was going to go for the adorable Narwhal or her favorite imaginary animal, the unicorn.

Don't forget to grab a matching lunchbox for whichever cute critter you pick!

#### Crayons
No doubt she will need crayons as she's learning the names of all the colors. Crayola makes the best crayons because they are bright and go on easy. This year we will have two sets.

These triangular crayons are awesome because they are less likely to roll off the table onto a dirty floor.

#### Smocks
We're starting nursery school this year so we plan on getting really messy. Smocks to the rescue (at least for our super cute clothes!). These smocks are perfect, they're long sleeve, with elastic around the wrist, and long enough to cover most of her.
