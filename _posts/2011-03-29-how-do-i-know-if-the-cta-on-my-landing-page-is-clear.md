Use a blur test to see if your **call-to-action** is clear. I tested the headliner.fm homepage to see if I was able to find the sign up button, even if the text is unreadable. Sure enough, I found a few things that could be improved.

<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-34" title="headlienr_blur" src="http://www.iamchristinabot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/headlienr_blur-300x218.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="218" srcset="http://www.iamchristinabot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/headlienr_blur-300x218.jpg 300w, http://www.iamchristinabot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/headlienr_blur.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />

<p style="text-align: center;">
  &nbsp;
</p>

&#8211; Orange is the dominant button color, but that link brings up a &#8216;How It Works&#8217; video.
  
&#8211; Having two buttons makes decision making a bit more difficult and we all know, users don&#8217;t want to think. =]

Here&#8217;s the improved headliner homepage.

I now have one clear call to action on the homepage, moving on to other things.
