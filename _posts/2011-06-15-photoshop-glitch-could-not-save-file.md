&#8220;Could not save (file name) because the file is already in use or left open.&#8221;

If you&#8217;re on a mac getting this error, try this for a solution:
  
Force Quit on Finder so that it restarts.

There may be several solutions, so this may not necessarily be the fix for you, but give it a shot!
