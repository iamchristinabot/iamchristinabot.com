According to W3C, you can add lang=&#8221;en&#8221; (for english) attribute to your HTML tag and this is still valid for HTML5.
  
Here are some other options for the lang attribute:

&#8220;en&#8221;: English
  
&#8220;en-US&#8221;: the U.S. version of English.
  
&#8220;en-cockney&#8221;: the Cockney version of English.
  
&#8220;i-navajo&#8221;: the Navajo language spoken by some Native Americans.
