For as long as I can remember, I&#8217;ve loved the Coca Cola branding, not only the vintage posters but also the logo design. The very first Coca Cola logo was not the world-famous Spencerian Script logo that we&#8217;ve all come to love but actually was just a plain ol&#8217; sans serif type. From what I gather, this logo was only used in a couple of newspaper printings very early on in the company&#8217;s development.

In 1885/86 the Coca-Cola bookkeeper, Frank Mason Robinson designed THE fancy-pants script logo that Coca-Cola is so well known by. In terms of design, the logo is distinct, youthful and vibrant, so it&#8217;s pretty much perfect for promoting soda but it&#8217;s also important that the brand has been **consistant** with their identity.

I love Coca-Cola for being so consistently badass and iconic.
