Doing my third day of the Pomodoro Technique, here&#8217;s a bit on how it keeps me focused on my work.

Using the Pomodoro LE iPhone app, I work in **25 minute increments followed by 5 minutes of break time**, after the fourth repetition I get 30 minutes of break time. I only let myself check my social media pages during break, if something extracurricular comes up that is related to work I let myself do that too. First day I did 10 Pommies, as I like to call them, second day was 11 &#8211; today I&#8217;m going for 8 or 9 just because it&#8217;s been a bit intense.
