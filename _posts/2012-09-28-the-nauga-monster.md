One of these days I&#8217;m going to buy myself a Nauga Monster, you may not believe it but this little guy is vintage.

In the 1960&#8217;s Uniroyal created a synthetic fabric called Naugahyde which was an alternative to leather used for furniture.  According to Uniroyal, this vinyl/faux-leather came from an animal they imagined, called the Nauga Monster, who became the company&#8217;s mascot.  These Nauga Monsters shed their skin naturally, leaving no Nauga&#8217;s harmed in the manufacturing of their furniture goods.  To learn more about the history of Naugahyde, [visit their website](http://www.naugahyde.com/history.html).

This stuffed faux-leather toy stands 11&#8243; tall and 16&#8243; wide, he became the friendly face of Uniroyal&#8217;s promotional efforts.  They offered a free Nauga doll with each Naugahyde reupholstering. It is rumored that furniture designer, Charles Eames is the creator of the monster but I&#8217;m yet to find official documentation of this.
