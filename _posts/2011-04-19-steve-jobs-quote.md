I love this steve jobs quote, from his speech at Stanford, I think about it often.

> I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: &#8220;If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?&#8221; And whenever the answer has been &#8220;No&#8221; for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.

I am happy to say it&#8217;s been a long time since I consistently looked in the mirror said &#8220;No.&#8221;
