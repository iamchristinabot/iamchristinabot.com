You may have noticed some cruddy black dots surrounding text or what looks like a black outline or border when fading in and out with Internet Explorer 7. This is actually a bug but before you go crazy, here&#8217;s the fix.

**Set the background color of the parent container with CSS.**

Yep, it&#8217;s that easy.

_ps._ This issue is different from [FireFox cleartype bug](http://www.iamchristinabot.com/blog/20110325/how-do-i-fix-edgy-text-in-firefox-from-jquerys-fadein-fadeout/) which displays thin, crunchy text.
