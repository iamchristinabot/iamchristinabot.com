I&#8217;ve always considered myself &#8220;self-taught&#8221; because I don&#8217;t have a formal education in design or development, it&#8217;s always been my hobby.  The other day I read that a developer/designer cannot be self taught because we&#8217;re always learning from each other and it made me question myself.  Is there a such thing as self taught?

Since most of my learning came from reading other peoples code and studying their pixels, I&#8217;d have to agree that a lot of what I know has been learned from others and that I never would have written HTML or CSS if I hadn&#8217;t seen it elsewhere.  But how is learning from each other any different from learning in an institution?  Whether your in a class room or your at home viewing the source of other people&#8217;s code, it&#8217;s still learning from somewhere but that&#8217;s not the point.

There is something special about this idea of being self taught, it doesn&#8217;t refer to where or how you get your information, it&#8217;s about the drive to learn without a teacher. I was not formally trained to write code, so I attribute this education to my own curiosity and persistence.  Everything I&#8217;ve done up to this point is my own,  it&#8217;s not more mine than it would be if I were trained in an institution.
