After coming back from a vacation quarantined in a Cape Cod house and months of sitting in my house binge eating Annie's snacks and watching Schitt's Creek, I really use a regular schedule of exercise. My gym routine was derailed by Covid-19 and I'm ready to try something new. Peloton seemed like it could be a good fit so I visited their showroom in Westport, CT. I'll skip the experience there, to make a long story short, we're absolutely getting one so now it's time to accessorize. So excited! Here are the things I need:

#### Heart Rate Monitor
Maybe it is the nerd in me, but numbers excite me in a way they don’t excite most people working out, which is why I can’t wait to try this heart rate monitor armband. When I was previously at a gym (remember those?) I wore an armband and the metrics were inspiring, they always made me want to push that much harder than I previously did. This monitor from Amazon is Peloton ready and comes with an extra band so and your significant other can share the same device. Also, check out the super cool colors, you guys.

#### Floor Mat
I’ve seen my husband work out at the gym and after a few minutes of cardio I’m convinced he is melting, he gets really sweaty. The last thing we want is our floors to warp while riding our new spin bike so this exercise mat looks perfect. At a fraction of the cost of the Peloton brand, this is moisture resistant and easy to clean, guaranteeing our floors will live to see another day.
