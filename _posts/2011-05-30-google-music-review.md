With Google Music, you can listen to your music from anywhere you have an internet connection because all your songs are stored in a cloud. That means: no more syncing music to devices other than your computer (ie. work computer, phone etc.). Since I don&#8217;t have an android phone, I&#8217;m reviewing the interface of the web application only. With that being said, I think it&#8217;s an interesting product and if something similar were adopted by Apple where internet wasn&#8217;t necessary (a bit more like drop box) I&#8217;d absolutely use it.

**Very Clean & Intuitive Interface**
  
Super nice minimal UI, everything is where it&#8217;s expected it to be. I&#8217;m a fan of the transitions between views and the classy hover effects.

Left side of the application displays options where you can select to view by &#8220;Song&#8221;, &#8220;Author&#8221;, &#8220;Album&#8221;, &#8220;Genre&#8221;, &#8220;New&#8221;, &#8220;Thumbs Up&#8221; or playlists. When one of those is selected the right column populates with a detailed view in album cover view except for song title which will give you a neat sortable table.

The only qualm I have is that I didn&#8217;t know songs could be played by double clicking since web-apps don&#8217;t typically have that characteristic, but I would have stumbled upon it eventually.

**Currently Playing Song**
  
I often have a hard time finding the play button on iTunes pretty frequently but don&#8217;t think I could ever have that problem here since the icon flashes as the song plays.

**Search**
  
Though it may seam basic and possibly limiting to some people, I&#8217;m a fan of this search and I&#8217;ll tell you why. This search doesn&#8217;t care if I&#8217;m looking for an album artist or song title, it just gives me the results I want whereas in iTunes I have to select one of those options with a checkmark or be faced with a ton of results.

**No Keyboard Controls**
  
When using the web app, keyboard controls cannot be accessed if the tab isn&#8217;t in focus.

**Song Title Changes in Browser Tab**
  
Can&#8217;t think of any form of this feature in iTunes, I&#8217;d hope that right clicking the iTunes doc would but it doesn&#8217;t so I think this feature is pretty nice.

**Ratings are Limited**
  
I&#8217;m a big advocate of using the iTunes 5 star rating and make an effort to rate every song in my music collection. Every couple of weeks I delete stars with one star because lets be serious who wants to hear songs they don&#8217;t even like? Anyway, this rating system is too limited for me though.

**Still a Bit Buggy**
  
Resizing browser hides the controls for volume shuffle and repeat.

Site is unusable if sized down too small.

Knowing that Google Music is still in Beta is very promising.
