I noticed my layout breaking a little bit in tablet responsive view and wanted &#8220;member login&#8221; to appear as &#8220;login&#8221; to save on space.  An easy way of doing this is to wrap the word &#8220;member&#8221; in a span tag with the class .hidden-xs .hidden-sm or .hidden-md etc.  This simply hides the element in that browser size.
