#### Poop Bags
If you are like me you feel some sort of guilt using plastic bags to pick up dog poop but hey, what else can you do? In search of finding some that were environmentally friendly, I came across these that are made with 38% biobased materials and meet the USDA Certified Biobased Program. There's room to tie a knot and the bags are thick enough so they don't leak.

#### Eating Gear
For the times you and your buddy are on the go, this is the perfect canteen. This bottle doubles as a bowl so your pup can quench his/her thirst and won't spill an entire bottle of water onto the ground. If only these guys can learn how to sip politely!
