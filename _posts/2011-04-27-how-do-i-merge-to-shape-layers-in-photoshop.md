All these years and I had no idea that I could do this, well here&#8217;s how it&#8217;s done.

**1. Draw shapes drawn in different layers.**

<img src="{{ site.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-26-at-9.33.40-PM.png" alt="" title="Screen shot 2011-04-26 at 9.33.40 PM" width="600" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55" srcset="http://www.iamchristinabot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-26-at-9.33.40-PM.png 600w, http://www.iamchristinabot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-26-at-9.33.40-PM-300x235.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />

2. Select one of your shape layers by clicking on **the square to the right of that layer**. You&#8217;ll know if you did this correctly because it is outlined with brackets.

<img src="{{ site.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-26-at-9.35.02-PM.png" alt="" title="Screen shot 2011-04-26 at 9.35.02 PM" width="220" height="193" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56" />

3. Hit Copy (Cmd + C).

4. Select another shape layer in the same way, you need to get the bracket around the right box so you know you&#8217;re selected.

<img src="{{ site.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-26-at-9.38.18-PM.png" alt="" title="Screen shot 2011-04-26 at 9.38.18 PM" width="220" height="205" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57" />

5. Hit Paste (Cmd + V).

Wheee! Now go crazy merging your shapes nerd!
