I throughly enjoyed [this Interview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfzLzOl795E&feature=related) from 1956 where Charles and Ray Eames introduce the famous Eames Lounge Chair and Ottoman.  I love how they both seem sort of awkward in an adorable way, especially Ray.  The quote at the end describes their product so well and is so beautifully said:

> The Eames desire to move freely in a world of enormous unlimited possibilities is combined with a very accurate sense of discrimination and taste. This is an ability to select among the unlimited probabilities and return considerable richness to the world.
