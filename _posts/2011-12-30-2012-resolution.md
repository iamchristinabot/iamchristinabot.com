I&#8217;ve found that setting a resolution for the new year has been effective in making me a better person so I put a lot of thought into what it is about myself that I want to work on.  These past few weeks have been pretty hectic inside and out so I&#8217;ve finally decided, my new year&#8217;s resolution is to be more patient &#8211; take things lightly and to have a more peaceful state of mind.
