Are you a Facebook Junkie? Well, good news&#8230; the first step to recovery is admitting that you have a problem. Next step is to download <a href="http://visitsteve.com/made/selfcontrol" target="_blank">Self Control App</a> by Steve Lambert.

Self Control is a simple OS X application that allows you to blacklist certain websites from being accessed during a particular period of time. Once you hit start, there&#8217;s no easy way to quit, even end task is useless.

* * *You can also ask Self Control to only allow certain domains to be accessed during a certain period of time, which is like the supreme way to focus.</p> 

Self Control helps me battle the black hole that is Facebook, I hope you will all try this app to help fight off your demons.
