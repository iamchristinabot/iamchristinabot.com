It got me thinking about how lucky I am to have so many unconditional friendships: _people who love me no matter what_. I believe that a good part of me is a summary of everyone I&#8217;ve ever met and so I&#8217;m especially grateful to have so many wonderful people in my life. Thank you for having faith in me and teaching me new things, I&#8217;m looking forward to so much more.
