    <h1>2012 Resolution</h1>
    <p><p>I’ve found that setting a resolution for the new year has been effective in making me a better person so I put a lot of thought into what it is about myself that I want to work on.  These past few weeks have been pretty hectic inside and out so I’ve finally decided, my new year’s resolution is to be more patient – take things lightly and to have a more peaceful state of mind.</p>
