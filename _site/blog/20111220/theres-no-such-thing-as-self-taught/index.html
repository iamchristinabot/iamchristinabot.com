              <h1>There IS a such thing as self-taught</h1>
              <p><p>I’ve always considered myself “self-taught” because I don’t have a formal education in design or development, it’s always been my hobby.  The other day I read that a developer/designer cannot be self taught because we’re always learning from each other and it made me question myself.  Is there a such thing as self taught?</p>

<p>Since most of my learning came from reading other peoples code and studying their pixels, I’d have to agree that a lot of what I know has been learned from others and that I never would have written HTML or CSS if I hadn’t seen it elsewhere.  But how is learning from each other any different from learning in an institution?  Whether your in a class room or your at home viewing the source of other people’s code, it’s still learning from somewhere but that’s not the point.</p>

<p>There is something special about this idea of being self taught, it doesn’t refer to where or how you get your information, it’s about the drive to learn without a teacher. I was not formally trained to write code, so I attribute this education to my own curiosity and persistence.  Everything I’ve done up to this point is my own,  it’s not more mine than it would be if I were trained in an institution.</p>
