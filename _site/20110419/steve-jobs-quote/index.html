    <h1>Steve Jobs Quote</h1>
    <p><p>I love this steve jobs quote, from his speech at Stanford, I think about it often.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: “If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?” And whenever the answer has been “No” for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am happy to say it’s been a long time since I consistently looked in the mirror said “No.”</p>
